# Monet GAN Image Generation Project

This repository contains a pipeline to generate Monet-style images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Kaggle's "I'm Something of a Painter Myself" competition.

## Project Structure
- **`monet_gan_pipeline.py`**: Main script for data exploration, model training, image generation, and submission file creation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Dependencies list.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- **Dataset**: Ensure the dataset is in /kaggle/input/gan-getting-started (if on Kaggle).

- **Run the Script**: Execute monet_gan_pipeline.py to explore, train, and generate images.

- **Submission**: images.zip is created with generated images, ready for submission on Kaggle.
